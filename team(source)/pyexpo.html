            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy_beacon">ABOUT BLE BEACONS</a>
            <p>A BLE sensor is a sensor that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to transmit data wirelessly. BLE is a low-power version of Bluetooth, which makes it ideal for use in battery-powered devices. BLE sensors can be used to measure a variety of physical and environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, light, motion, and pressure</p>

            <h3 style="color: black;"> ⭐ DEFINITION ⭐</h3>
            <p style="font-style: oblique;">Start/End Points: Indicate the beginning and end of the communication process.
                Processes: Represent specific actions or tasks, such as advertising, scanning, connection establishment, service discovery, data exchange, and disconnection. These are often represented by rectangles.
                Decisions: Represent points where a choice is made, affecting the flow of the process. These are often represented by diamonds. For example, "Is the connection successful?"
                Arrows: Show the direction of the flow between different steps.
                Conditions/Labels: Describe the conditions or data associated with each step or decision.
                Swimlanes (Optional): Can be used to separate the actions of different devices</p>
